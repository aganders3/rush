# `rush`

This is a very basic shell written to familiarize myself with Rust.

It's basically an implementation of [this project](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/Projects/P1/p1.html) from the Operating Systems course at UW - Madison (my alma mater, though I did not take this course). I'm not exactly following the directions from that assignment, but close enough.
